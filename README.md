# Welcome to STEM Connect +
⭐ What it is: An all-encompassing app for women in STEM to find connections with mentors, opportunities and a place to record their journey as they navigate through their careers (Designed and Developed for SheHacks+ 6).

## The inspiration 
⭐ There is a discrepancy between the number of girls and women pursuing careers in STEM versus the number of boys and men. In fact, according to UNICEF, globally, 18% of girls in tertiary education are studying STEM compared to 35% of boys. This gender gap can be explained by factors such as lifestyle values, field-specific ability beliefs, gender-based stereotypes and bias. We wanted to create an app that connects girls and women in STEM to mentors and opportunities and foster an empowering community in order to bridge this gender gap and diversify the field.

## What it does
⭐ STEM Connect+ is an app to help women in STEM navigate their careers and connect with a community that leaves them feeling empowered. Features include: 
- Users have the ability to network with people all over the world who share similar aspirations and interests as them.
- Users can view posts and stories from other people as well as post their own content.
- STEM Connect+ has a focus on mentorship. The app uses an algorithm to match mentees to potential mentors based on their field of pursuit as well as career and mentorship goals.
- A direct messaging feature is also included which allows mentees and mentors to reach out, chat, and share posts.
- The app also has a unique journaling feature that enables users to track their moods and access resources that can improve their mental health. This can help users visualize their mood and hopefully recognize what triggers low moods and how they can cope.

## How we built it
⭐ The app was developed on Replit using HTML, CSS, Javascript and C#. The prototype and wire-framing was designed on Figma.
